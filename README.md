# Radio List [ Flutter App ]

Radio List is an application that allows users to add information about their car radio, such as technical parameters (e.g. size, backlight color, available functions such as Bluetooth, AUX, USB, CD), photo, model name, description, purchase price sales price and product quality. 
Users can edit the added items, move them to the sold list or remove them. The application allows you to preview the photo of the radio. With this app, users have the ability to track their products and manage sales and individual items more easily, so they can gain more control over their investments.
